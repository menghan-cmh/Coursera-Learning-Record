        - who made the change
    - collaboration
        - peer review when the code is ready for inspection
    - automation: plays an integral role and the explosion of development operation
        - track changes
            - aid in software quality
            - release and deployment
        - DevOps
            - set of practices, philosophies, and tools
            - increase ability
